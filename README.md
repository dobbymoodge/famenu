## FVWM-Alike Menu ##

Customizable hotkey-accessible general-purpose menus that run in the background.

This app allows you to define menus using a simple syntax that can be called up at will using a hotkey, like `Alt-minus`. The app runs in the background so it is responsive even under load.

TODO:
* Add more detail to README
* Add noop actions (for separators)
* Pop up menu on current desktop instead of desktop menu was started on (only affects FVWM?)
